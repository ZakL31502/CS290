            <p>
                The only real challenge to this assignment was learning how to publish pages and use git. I had a friend
                help me learn how to use git and github, and there was material in the class about publishing pages.

            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
            <p>
                This assignment mostly was just a repeat of what we learned in class about HTML, but it did give me a
                fun time experimenting with css. I wasn't able to figure out how to do columns too well, but it was very fun.
            </p>
            <li>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>
                The most helpful resources for this assignment are the class notes on the class website. I referenced
                them whenever I wasn't sure about formatting.
