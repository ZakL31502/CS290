            <li>What is the most interesting thing I have done with Web Development?</li>
            <p>
                When I was in middle school, I took a coding class which had me make a website, which
                had buttons leading to pages and whatnot. My friends and I made a fake card game store.
            </p>
            <li>What do I want to learn from this class?</li>
            <p>
                I am really excited on learning how to make websites, or to possibly learn databases later on.
                I am excited to make a code blog, I was thinking I could maintain it throughout my career at OSU.
                Make it look very nice and store all the code I do. It could be a portfolio of sorts!
            </p>
            <li>Have I signed up for Campuswire?</li>
            <p>
                Yes!
            </p>
            <li>An interesting fact about me?</li>
            <p>
                One interesting fact about me is that I recently switched to the CS major. I was previously
                a Mechanical Engineering major, but I wasn't feeling fulfilled in my classes. I took some CS
                classes because I remembered enjoying it in high school/middle school, and it clicked instantly.
                I am very happy with my CS classes and love my new major.
