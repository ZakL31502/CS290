        <ol>
            <li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. 
                How did you solve those problems?
            </li>
            <p>
                This assignment was pretty easy. The hard part was figuring out when I was grabbing the correct
                selectors, because I kept appending to the wrong things. Figuring out filters was also slightly
                rough, as there was much more than to be expected in that part.
            </p>
            <li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? 
                What did you find that you already knew?
            </li>
            <p>
                This assignment taught me a lot about properly managing where you are in the DOM. That was probably
                the hardest part so it was good to learn. I found overall it wasn't too bad of an assignment though, 
                and learned I enjoyed writing in JS.
            </p>
            <li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? 
                The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
            </li>
            <p>
                I did recieve some help from google as well as classmates, who while they did not give me code, would
                help me walk through why something might not be working, or what I should look at to solve a problem.
            </p>
            <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</li>
            <p>
                I had to google how to turn a string to having the first letter in uppercase, to look nice for extra
                credit.
