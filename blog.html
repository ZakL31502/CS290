        <ol>
            <li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. 
                How did you solve those problems?
            </li>
            <p>
                The challenging part of this assignment was managing to do it on time from other responsibilities.
                I dedicated my Monday to the assignment, which made small things like text or spacing frustrating on occassion.
                I simply worked through it as best as I could, step by step.
            </p>
            <li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? 
                What did you find that you already knew?
            </li>
            <p>
                This assignment taught me a lot more about how spacing works, and the usage of flexboxes. It was nice to
                get a more hands-on experience with them.
            </p>
            <li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? 
                The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
            </li>
            <p>
                Mostly I just experimented and it was pretty fun, but I used google, the lecture notes, and example code.
                Google was for specific issues I had, the lecture notes were to brush up on topics I forgot (such as margin vs padding),
                and the demo code was to see an example of how flexboxes were used
            </p>
            <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</li>
            <p>
                I had to google a flexbox guide of CSS-tricks to understand more about how flexboxes worked.
