        <h2>10/10/2022 - Assignment 4 Published</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</li>
            <p>
                The hardest part by far was reading the file correctly, as it took me forever to learn that I was doing it
                wrong, and the reading in of the file did not require functions for errors, which makes sense as the errors are
                handled by 404.html. 
            </p>
            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
            <p>
                This assignment taught me a lot about servers and node.js, which I definitely was not confident in before the assignment.
            </p>
            <li>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>
                In this assignment I looked all over the place, the lecture notes, the lecture recordings, the example code,
                and random youtube videos as I tried to find out how to read a file. I ended up combining all these resources
                as I figured this assignment out.
            </p>
            <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</li>
            <p>
                I had to google what the content types were for headers, as well as looking into ways to cache, although
                I did not use them as I found out I was very much overcomplicating them.
